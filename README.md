To get this project up and running, follow the steps below. First, make sure you start the **server**, then start the **client**.

## 🚀 Start the Server

   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 💻 Start the Client

1. Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
